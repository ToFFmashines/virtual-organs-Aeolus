# Set of organs profile for Aeolus

I have prepared a draft of virtual organs. The number of keys and stops is only informative and is not a dogma.
I assume a division into groups of instruments:

## vicar’s organ
- manual I - keyboard compass: 49 notes, no. of organ stops up to 8

This is class of Portative pipe organ in the smallest version with manual only. Usually it is a movable organ, more detailed specifications are on the wiki page [Positive organ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_organ) or static [Portative organ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portative_organ).

A description of the prepared profiles is available in the [documentation of Vicar's organs](/doc/vicars-organ.md), custom stops settings can then be downloaded from the [directory Vicar](/Vicar)

## pastor’s organ
- manual I - keyboard compass: 57 notes, no. of organ stops up to 8
- pedal - pedal compass: 24 notes, no. of organ stops up to 4

## dean’s organ
- namuál I - keyboard compass: 61 notes, no. of organ stops up to 12
- manual II - keyboard compass: 61 notes, no. of organ stops up to 12
- pedal - pedal compass: 32 notes, no. of organ stops up to 8

## archpriest’s organ
- namuál I - keyboard compass: 61 notes, no. of organ stops up to 16
- manual II - keyboard compass: 61 notes, no. of organ stops up to 16

## bishop’s organ

- manual III - keyboard compass: 61 notes, no. of organ stops up to 16

This organ class corresponds to the standard settings of the Aeolus program. There is a repository with settings for three differently equipped pipe organs called Aeolus, Aeolus1 and Aeolus2, but with a basis in the same stops. Direct link to the origin source is here [stops-0.4.0.tar.bz2](https://kokkinizita.linuxaudio.org/linuxaudio/downloads/stops-0.4.0.tar.bz2)

At this time the Bishop’s directory is identically to original stops-0.4.0 files for Aeolus.
